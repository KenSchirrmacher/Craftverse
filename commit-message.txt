feat(wild-update): Implement Boat with Chest feature

This commit adds the Boat with Chest feature from the Wild Update:

- Fix entity ID preservation in Entity.deserialize
- Update Boat entity to support inventory storage for chest boats
- Improve Boat serialization and deserialization for proper persistence
- Ensure proper item drops when breaking boats with chests
- Fix boat breaking mechanics to drop both the boat and its contents

This implementation allows players to store items in boats with chests (27 slots),
supports all wood types, and correctly handles serialization, breaking, and drops.
All tests are now passing for this feature.
