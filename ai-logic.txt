   - Tests for registry and item system integration

The Armor Trims implementation provides players with a way to customize their armor with unique visual patterns, using materials that determine the color. This feature adds a new dimension of personalization without changing armor stats, encouraging exploration to find the various trim templates in different structures.

This completes another key feature of the Trails & Tales Update, with both Camel mobs and Armor Trims now fully implemented and tested.

Next steps:
1. Implement the Complete Pottery System feature

### 2024-08-16: Trails & Tales Update - Complete Pottery System Implementation ###

I've successfully completed the Pottery System implementation for the Trails & Tales Update with the following enhancements and fixes:

1. Fixed serialization/deserialization in all three main components:
   - PotBase: Fixed serialize method to use toJSON() from parent class
   - DecoratedPotItem: Fixed serialize method and added missing placeable property
   - DecoratedPot: Fixed serialization and property initialization

2. Validated the entire Pottery System implementation:
   - All tests are now passing in potterySystemTest.js
   - Confirmed proper behavior with simplePotteryTest.js
   - The complete Pottery System accurately represents Minecraft's implementation

3. The Pottery System includes the following components:
   - PotBase item for crafting decorated pots
   - PotterySherdItem with various patterns and categories
   - DecoratedPotItem that can be placed in the world
   - DecoratedPot block with inventory capabilities
   - Complete crafting recipes for all components
   - Proper integration with the game's item and block systems

The Pottery System allows players to collect pottery sherds through archaeology, craft pot bases from clay, and combine them to create decorated pots with various patterns. The pots can store a single item stack and maintain their decoration patterns when broken and picked up. This implementation completes another key feature of the Trails & Tales Update.

Next steps:
1. Mark the Pottery System as complete in the project tracking
2. Move on to implementing the next feature in the Trails & Tales Update: Hanging Signs

### 2024-08-16: Trails & Tales Update - Hanging Signs Implementation Plan ###

Next, I'll implement the Hanging Signs feature from the Trails & Tales Update. Based on my analysis, there doesn't appear to be an existing sign implementation in the codebase. Therefore, I need to:

1. Create a comprehensive SignBlock base class that will serve as the foundation for both regular signs and hanging signs:
   - Support for different sign materials (oak, spruce, birch, etc.)
   - Text editing and formatting capabilities
   - Proper interaction handling
   - Directional placement (wall-mounted or standing)

2. Implement the HangingSignBlock class extending from SignBlock:
   - Support for ceiling and chain attachment
   - Different visual appearance and behavior from regular signs
   - Proper support chain visualization
   - All wood variants support
   - Different placement mechanics (requires block above)

3. Add HangingSignItem that places the HangingSignBlock
   - Material-specific variants
   - Proper placement validation
   - Integration with crafting system

4. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Test placement mechanics for hanging signs
   - Test text editing functionality
   - Test attachment points (ceiling, chain, wall)
   - Test proper serialization/deserialization
   - Test breaking mechanics and drops

I'll approach this by first creating a base SignBlock implementation, then extending it for HangingSignBlock to avoid duplicating code. I'll ensure proper integration with the existing block and item systems.

### 2024-08-17: Trails & Tales Update - Hanging Signs Implementation Complete ###

I've successfully implemented the Hanging Signs feature for the Trails & Tales Update with the following components:

1. Created a comprehensive SignBlock base class:
   - Support for all wood types (oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark_oak, mangrove, cherry, bamboo, crimson, warped)
   - Text editing with up to 4 lines
   - Text color and formatting (including glowing text)
   - Waxing mechanism to prevent further editing
   - Different variants for standing and wall-mounted signs
   - Proper serialization/deserialization

2. Implemented the HangingSignBlock class:
   - Support for three attachment types: ceiling, chain, and wall
   - Physics validation to ensure signs stay attached to valid surfaces
   - Proper rotation based on player placement angle
   - Special behaviors for different attachment types
   - Automatic block breaking when support is removed

3. Added HangingSignItem for sign placement:
   - Support for all wood types
   - Intelligent placement logic based on clicked face
   - Detection of valid placement positions
   - Proper item tooltips and metadata

4. Implemented hanging sign crafting recipes:
   - Recipes for all wood types
   - Support for using either stripped logs or planks
   - Proper chain requirements
   - Yields 6 signs per craft

5. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Tests for all SignBlock base functionality
   - Tests for HangingSignBlock placement validation
   - Tests for different attachment types
   - Tests for crafting recipes
   - Tests for serialization/deserialization

All tests are now passing, and the Hanging Signs feature is complete. Players can now craft and place hanging signs in a variety of wood types, with different mounting options (ceiling, chain, or wall). The signs can be edited, colored, and waxed to prevent further changes, just like in the official Minecraft Trails & Tales Update.

Next steps:
1. Mark the Hanging Signs feature as complete in project.txt
2. Begin implementing the Chiseled Bookshelf feature, which is the last remaining feature for the Trails & Tales Update

# Implementation of Chiseled Bookshelf Feature

## Analysis of Requirements
- Chiseled Bookshelf is a decorative storage block introduced in the Trails & Tales Update
- It can store up to 6 books (any type of book item)
- The bookshelf emits a redstone signal based on how many slots are filled
- The block remembers its rotation to determine front-facing orientation

## Implementation Plan
1. Created ChiseledBookshelfBlock with 6-slot inventory for storing books
2. Created ChiseledBookshelfItem for placing the block in the world
3. Added book validation, slot-specific interactions and redstone signal output
4. Created comprehensive tests to verify functionality

## Conclusion
The Chiseled Bookshelf feature is now fully implemented with book storage functionality, rotation-aware interaction, redstone signal output, and full test coverage.

### 2024-08-18: 1.20 Update - Bamboo Wood Set Implementation Analysis ###

After analyzing the current state of the Craftverse project, I've determined we need to implement the Bamboo wood set for the 1.20 Update. I've observed the following:

### Current Issue Being Fixed ###
The Cherry Grove biome tests were failing with: "AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Stripped cherry log should be registered". 

To fix this issue:
1. Created a dedicated StrippedCherryLog class that extends LogBlock with proper properties
2. Updated blockRegistry.js to import and register the StrippedCherryLog class properly
3. Updated tests to explicitly check for stripped cherry log properties
4. All tests now pass successfully, confirming the Cherry Grove biome is fully implemented

The issue was that we were previously passing the stripped cherry log as an option to CherryLog, but the test was expecting it to be a fully registered block of its own class. With the implementation of a dedicated StrippedCherryLog class, all tests now pass.

### 2024-08-19: Fix for Cherry Blossom Biome Tests ###

The Cherry Grove biome tests were failing with: "AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Stripped cherry log should be registered".

2. Updated blockRegistry.js to import and register the StrippedCherryLog class properly
3. Updated tests to explicitly check for stripped cherry log properties
4. All tests now pass successfully, confirming the Cherry Grove biome is fully implemented

The issue was that we were previously passing the stripped cherry log as an option to CherryLog, but the test was expecting it to be a fully registered block of its own class. With the implementation of a dedicated StrippedCherryLog class, all tests now pass.

### 2024-08-19: Fixed Cherry Blossom Biome Implementation ###

The Cherry Grove biome tests were failing with: "AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Stripped cherry log should be registered". To fix this issue, I:

1. Created a dedicated StrippedCherryLog class that extends LogBlock with proper properties
2. Updated blockRegistry.js to import and register the StrippedCherryLog class properly
3. Updated tests to explicitly check for stripped cherry log properties
4. All tests now pass successfully, confirming the Cherry Grove biome is fully implemented

The issue was that we were previously passing the stripped cherry log as an option to CherryLog, but the test was expecting it to be a fully registered block of its own class. With the implementation of a dedicated StrippedCherryLog class, all tests now pass.

The Cherry Blossom biome is now fully implemented with the following components:
- Cherry Grove biome with pink aesthetic and special ground coverage

The next task is to implement the Netherite upgrade template for the 1.20 Update.

### 2024-08-19: Implementing Netherite Upgrade Template for 1.20 Update ###

After completing the Raft system, the next feature to implement is the Netherite upgrade template for the 1.20 Update. In Minecraft 1.20, upgrading diamond gear to netherite now requires a specific smithing template item, rather than using just a netherite ingot directly.

Current status:
1. We already have a SmithingTable class implementation
2. We have netherite items and recipes implemented
3. We have armor trims implemented using a template-based system
4. The current smithing system allows direct diamond-to-netherite upgrades without a template

Plan to implement Netherite upgrade template:
1. Create a new NetheriteUpgradeTemplate class that extends Item:
   - Similar structure to ArmorTrimItem but for netherite upgrades
   - Specific properties and methods for netherite upgrade functionality
   - JSON serialization/deserialization support

2. Update the SmithingTable class:
   - Modify the process method to require a template for netherite upgrades
   - Update existing diamond-to-netherite recipes to use the template
   - Ensure backward compatibility for existing tests if needed

3. Create appropriate item registration for the template:
   - Register the template in itemRegistry.js
   - Add appropriate crafting recipes for the template
   - Define loot table entries for finding the template

4. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Test NetheriteUpgradeTemplate class properties
   - Test smithing table integration with template requirement
   - Test upgrading all armor and tool types
   - Test property transfer when upgrading

I'll start by creating the NetheriteUpgradeTemplate class and then modify the SmithingTable to work with this new template.

### 2024-08-19: Implemented Netherite Upgrade Template for 1.20 Update ###

I've successfully completed the Netherite upgrade template implementation with the following components:

1. Created the NetheriteUpgradeTemplate class:
   - Extended the Item base class with template-specific properties
   - Added methods for checking compatibility with diamond equipment
   - Implemented JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Added metadata for source and usage instructions

2. Updated the SmithingTable class:
   - Added requireNetheriteTemplate flag for backward compatibility
   - Updated process method to check for template when upgrading diamond gear
   - Ensured property transfer when upgrading (enchantments, custom names, etc.)
   - Added compatibility with all diamond tool and armor types

3. Updated the item registry:
   - Registered the NetheriteUpgradeTemplate in itemRegistry.js
   - Updated the registerTrailsAndTalesItems method to include the template

4. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Created netheriteUpgradeTemplateTest.js for testing all aspects of the template
   - Created runNetheriteUpgradeTemplateTest.js test runner
   - Tested basic properties, smithing integration, and property preservation
   - Verified all tests are passing

The implementation now correctly requires a netherite upgrade template for upgrading diamond equipment to netherite, matching Minecraft 1.20's behavior. The backward compatibility flag allows toggling this requirement for older worlds if needed.

### 2024-08-19: Implementing Calibrated Sculk Sensor for 1.20 Update ###

Now that the Netherite upgrade template is complete, the next feature to implement is the Calibrated Sculk Sensor for the 1.20 Update. This is an advanced variant of the regular Sculk Sensor that allows filtering specific vibrations.

Current status:
1. We already have the regular SculkSensorBlock implementation
2. We have vibration detection mechanics in place
3. We have redstone signal emission from sculk sensors

Plan to implement Calibrated Sculk Sensor:
1. Create a new CalibratedSculkSensorBlock class that extends SculkSensorBlock:
   - Add filter system for specific vibration types
   - Implement frequency filtering mechanics
   - Add GUI for setting the vibration filter
   - Maintain all existing sculk sensor behaviors while adding the filtering

2. Update the block registry:
   - Register the CalibratedSculkSensorBlock
   - Add crafting recipes for the calibrated sensor (sculk sensor + amethyst shard)
   - Set up proper block textures and models

3. Implement vibration filtering logic:
   - Create vibration type enumeration for different sources
   - Add filter storage in block's state
   - Add filter check logic in the detect method

4. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Test basic calibrated sensor properties
   - Test vibration filtering logic
   - Test redstone signal emission for filtered vibrations
   - Test crafting and recipe registration

I'll start by examining the existing SculkSensorBlock implementation and then creating the CalibratedSculkSensorBlock with filtering capabilities.

### 2024-08-20: 1.20 Update - Calibrated Sculk Sensor Implementation ###

I've successfully implemented the Calibrated Sculk Sensor feature for the 1.20.0 Update. The calibrated sculk sensor is an advanced variant of the regular sculk sensor that can filter specific vibration types. Here's a summary of the implementation:

1. Created CalibratedSculkSensorBlock that extends SculkSensorBlock:
   - Implemented 15 different vibration filter types (step, break_block, place_block, etc.)
   - Added an extended vibration detection radius (12 blocks vs standard 8)
   - Implemented special filtering logic that outputs max redstone power when detecting matched vibrations
   - Created methods to set/get the filter type and handle filtered vibrations

2. Updated Block Registry:
   - Registered the CalibratedSculkSensorBlock in the block registry system
   - Ensured proper integration with the existing sculk sensor system

3. Added vibration filtering system:
   - Implemented player interaction to cycle through filter types
   - Added special handling for filtered vibrations to output maximum redstone power
   - Created a more sophisticated vibration detection system for specific events

4. Created comprehensive tests:
   - Tested basic properties and inheritance from SculkSensorBlock
   - Tested filter management (setting/getting filters, handling invalid filters)
   - Tested vibration filtering capabilities and signal output
   - Tested serialization/deserialization for proper data persistence
   - Verified all 15 filter types are working correctly

The implementation allows players to filter specific vibration types by interacting with the calibrated sculk sensor. When set to a specific filter type, the sensor will only detect vibrations of that type, ignoring all others. When a matching vibration is detected, the sensor always outputs full redstone power, making it useful for specific redstone contraptions.

All tests for the Calibrated Sculk Sensor are now passing, confirming that the feature is working correctly and behaving as expected.

With this implementation, we have successfully completed all planned features for the 1.20 Update, including:
- Bamboo wood set
- Rafts system
- Netherite upgrade template
- Calibrated sculk sensor

Next steps:
1. Review all 1.20 Update features for completeness
2. Plan for future updates and enhancements
