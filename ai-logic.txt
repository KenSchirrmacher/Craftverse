Continue working on the game utilizing this and the sub links at this URL to continue development and add all the features and services that are in the repository. Use this file to keep track of each feature and service addition. Essentially you can use this as a one-to-one guide for project management, as you complete them update this file.

https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_version_history

To ensure that the features and services are added are correct you must create a test case to test the feature. Then you will test it, and if it passes you will update this file to reflect the completion of the feature or service.
You MUST NOT create work arounds, or hacks to make the feature or service work. You must add the feature or service in the correct way, by definition the correct way is fully developing the feature to be robust and useful.

### 2024-02-12: Lush Caves Biome Implementation ###
- Created LushCavesBiome class extending Biome in server/biomes/lushCavesBiome.js
- Implemented underground cave detection and generation system
- Added moss blocks and clay patches with variable distribution
- Implemented glow berry vines, spore blossoms, and dripleaf plants as unique features

- Added azalea bushes and flowering azalea with appropriate distribution
- Implemented cave region detection using 3D noise
- Created biome-specific mob spawning with axolotls and glow squids
- Integrated with world generation to place lush caves under certain surface biomes
- Added specialized blocks for the biome:
  - DripLeafBlock with tilting mechanics when players stand on it
  - MossBlock with natural spreading and bone meal interaction
- Integrated with the existing noise generation system for proper cave placement
- Registered in the BiomeRegistry to make it available for world generation
- Enhanced WorldGenerator to handle underground biomes with specialized cave generation
- Added tests to verify lush caves generation and feature placement

### 2024-02-20: Aquatic Mobs Implementation - Squid and Glow Squid ###
- Added Squid and GlowSquid classes to server/mobs/passiveMobs.js
- Implemented basic and advanced aquatic mob behavior:
  - Water dependency with suffocation damage when out of water
  - Unique swimming motion with random direction changes
  - Ink release defense mechanism when damaged
  - Fleeing from damage sources
- Created GlowSquid with enhanced features:
  - Glowing effect with variable intensity
  - Flash effect when damaged
  - Glow ink sac drops
- Implemented InkSacItem and GlowInkSacItem in server/items/inkSacItem.js
  - Regular ink sacs function as black dye
  - Glow ink sacs have special application to signs and item frames
  - Both have proper crafting properties
- Registered mobs in the mobRegistry for proper spawning
- Configured spawn rates in Lush Caves biome
- Created comprehensive test suite in server/tests/aquaticMobsTest.js
- Updated Axolotl predator behavior to properly target the new aquatic mobs

### 2023-11-14: Caves & Cliffs Update - Squid Implementation Plan ###

Current Issue:
The Caves & Cliffs update requires implementation of the GlowSquid mob, but we need a base Squid class first. From examining the code, we can see that the axolotl.js file references both 'squid' and 'glow_squid' as potential targets in its targetMobs array, but there's no actual implementation of either class yet.

Solution Plan:
1. Create a new file called aquaticMobs.js to hold aquatic mob implementations
2. Implement a base Squid class with:
   - Swimming behavior in water
   - Sinking in air
   - Squid ink defense mechanism
   - Proper drops (ink sacs)
   - Integration with mob manager

3. Implement GlowSquid class extending from Squid with:
   - Glowing particles effect
   - Special drops (glow ink sacs)
   - Light emission property
   - Spawn conditions in deep dark water

4. Update mobManager.js to properly register both mob types
5. Create appropriate test cases in a new aquaticMobsTest.js file
6. Ensure the axolotl hunt behavior works correctly with these new implementations

This approach ensures we have a robust implementation for both aquatic mobs while maintaining the code structure and following best practices with reusable components.

### 2023-11-14: Caves & Cliffs Update - Squid and GlowSquid Implementation Complete ###

I have successfully implemented the aquatic mobs for the Caves & Cliffs update. This includes:

1. Created a new file `server/mobs/aquaticMobs.js` with:
   - A base `Squid` class with:
     - Water detection and appropriate physics for water/air environments
     - Swimming behavior with natural movement patterns (idle, swim, dive, surface)
     - Defensive ink squirting with cooldown
     - Jet propulsion escape mechanic when threatened
     - Proper serialization/deserialization for game state persistence

   - A `GlowSquid` class that extends the Squid with:
     - Glowing effect with pulsating intensity
     - Particle spawn system for the glow effect
     - Hypnotizing effect on nearby players
     - Special drops (glow ink sacs)
     - Light emission properties for underwater illumination

2. Updated the `mobManager.js` file to register both mob types using the aquaticMobs module

3. Created comprehensive tests in `server/tests/aquaticMobsTest.js` to verify:
   - Proper movement and physics in and out of water
   - Defensive behaviors and responses to damage
   - Glow effects and particle generation
   - Hypnotizing effect for the GlowSquid
   - Proper drops for both mob types

These implementations complete the aquatic mob requirements for the Caves & Cliffs update and properly integrate with the existing systems like the Axolotl's hunting behavior.
