### 2024-08-05: Wild Update - Mangrove Swamp Biome and Mud Blocks Implementation ###

I have successfully implemented the Mangrove Swamp biome and related mud blocks for the Wild Update:

1. Created a comprehensive `MangroveSwampBiome` class that extends BiomeBase:
   - Implemented appropriate climate properties for a warm, wet environment
   - Added visual properties for a swamp-like appearance (fog, water color, etc.)
   - Created terrain generation with shallow pools and uneven ground
   - Implemented feature generation for mangrove trees, roots, and vegetation
   - Added entity effects for movement on mud (slowness)
   - Created proper mob spawning tables with future frogs and tadpoles
   - Integrated with the BiomeRegistry for world generation

2. Implemented the Mud Block family:
   - Created base `MudBlock` class with:
     - Appropriate properties (hardness, resistance, sounds)
     - Slowing effect on entities that walk on it
     - Particle effects for a wet, bubbling appearance
     - Tool interactions (faster mining with shovels)
     - Interactions with water bottles and other tools
     - Proper serialization/deserialization

   - Created `PackedMudBlock` as a dried variant:
     - Harder and more resistant than regular mud
     - Can be created by drying regular mud
     - Interaction with water to revert to regular mud
     - Special block update handling for neighboring water
     - Used as crafting material for mud bricks

   - Created `MudBricksBlock` as a building material:
     - Crafted from packed mud
     - Higher hardness and blast resistance
     - Requires pickaxe for efficient mining
     - Decorative building block properties
     - Proper tool efficiency and mining mechanics

3. Updated the BlockRegistry to register all mud block variants

4. Created a comprehensive test suite for verification:
   - Tests for MangroveSwampBiome properties and generation
   - Tests for biome registration and climate matching
   - Tests for all three mud block types
   - Tests for entity interactions with mud
   - Tests for tool interactions and mining
   - Tests for special block behaviors and updates

The Mangrove Swamp biome and its mud blocks are key components of the Wild Update, providing a unique ecosystem with distinctive terrain, blocks, and mechanics. The implementation follows the standard Minecraft features while providing proper integration with the existing game systems.

Next steps will include:
1. Implementing Mangrove trees and their special root blocks
2. Creating Frog and Tadpole mobs with proper growth mechanics
3. Adding special items like Mangrove Propagules and Boat with Chest

### 2024-08-06: Wild Update - Allay Mob Implementation ###

I've successfully implemented the Allay mob for the Wild Update:

1. Created `Allay` class with the following features:
   - Flying physics with hover animation and proper movement
   - Item collection behavior that targets matching item types
   - Note block attraction and dancing mechanics
   - Following player behavior when given an item
   - Item duplication when interacting with note blocks with proper cooldown
   - State machine with different behaviors (idle, following, collecting, returning, dancing)
   - Proper serialization/deserialization

2. Updated MobManager to:
   - Register the Allay mob type
   - Include Allay in the possible passive mobs for spawning
   - Support Allay's special behaviors and interactions

3. Created comprehensive tests in allayTest.js:
   - Tests for basic Allay properties and behaviors
   - Tests for state transitions and AI behaviors
   - Tests for item collection logic and preferences
   - Tests for note block interaction and dancing
   - Tests for duplication mechanics and cooldown
   - Tests for movement physics and collision handling
   - Tests for MobManager integration

The Allay implementation adds another unique mob to the Wild Update, with special item collection behaviors that can assist players. The mob's attraction to note blocks and ability to duplicate provide interesting gameplay mechanics, while its flying nature makes it distinctive from other passive mobs.

Next steps:
1. Implement the remaining Wild Update features: Boat with Chest, Recovery Compass, and Echo Shards

### 2024-08-07: Wild Update - Boat with Chest Implementation ###

I've successfully implemented the Boat with Chest feature for the Wild Update:

1. Created the base `Entity` class with the following core features:
   - Common physics and collision handling
   - Entity serialization and deserialization
   - Event system for entity updates
   - Core lifecycle management (creation, updates, removal)
   - World interaction methods

2. Created `Boat` entity class that extends the base Entity class:
   - Water physics with buoyancy and wave effects
   - Passenger handling with player input processing
   - Collision detection and response
   - Inventory system for boats with chests (27 slots)
   - Item storage and retrieval methods
   - Damage and breaking mechanics with item drops
   - Proper serialization/deserialization

3. Created `BoatItem` class for placing boats in the world:
   - Support for all wood types (oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark_oak, mangrove)
   - Chest and non-chest variants
   - Water detection for placement
   - Proper integration with world's entity system
   - Event handling for placement

4. Updated the ItemRegistry to register all boat variants:
   - Added 7 wood types for regular boats
   - Added 7 wood types for boats with chests
   - Integrated with the existing item system

5. Created comprehensive tests in boatWithChestTest.js:
   - Tests for boat entity basics and properties
   - Tests for boat with chest inventory system
   - Tests for boat item placement in water
   - Tests for boat physics in water
   - Tests for passenger interactions
   - Tests for serialization/deserialization
   - Tests for breaking mechanics and item drops
   - Tests for item registration verification

The Boat with Chest implementation provides a new transportation item that allows players to carry more items while traveling by water. This is a key quality-of-life feature from the Wild Update that expands the game's inventory management options, particularly useful for exploration and resource gathering in aquatic environments.

Next steps:
1. Implement the remaining Wild Update features: Recovery Compass and Echo Shards

### 2024-08-08: Wild Update - Recovery Compass and Echo Shards Implementation ###

I've successfully implemented the Recovery Compass and Echo Shards for the Wild Update:

1. Enhanced the player death handling in server.js:
   - Added storage of player death location when they die
   - Included dimension tracking for cross-dimension support
   - Preserved last death location between respawns

2. Created `RecoveryCompassItem` class with the following features:
   - Points to the player's last death location
   - Displays distance and direction information
   - Dimension-aware functionality (doesn't track across dimensions)
   - Provides detailed death location coordinates when used
   - Proper serialization/deserialization

3. Created `EchoShardItem` class:
   - Defined as a crafting material for the Recovery Compass
   - Includes descriptive information about its use
   - Proper serialization/deserialization

4. Created a `CompassItem` class for the regular compass:
   - Points to world spawn by default
   - Supports lodestone tracking
   - Dimension-aware functionality

5. Created `CraftingManager` to handle crafting recipes:
   - Support for both shaped and shapeless recipes
   - Recipe matching functionality for crafting tables
   - Default recipes registration

6. Added Recovery Compass crafting recipe:
   - 8 Echo Shards surrounding 1 Compass in a ring pattern
   - Proper recipe registration in the crafting system

7. Created comprehensive tests in recoveryCompassTest.js:
   - Tests for Echo Shard registration and properties
   - Tests for Recovery Compass pointing mechanics
   - Tests for dimension-awareness in tracking
   - Tests for using the compass to get location information
   - Tests for crafting recipe validation
   - Tests for death location storage format

The Recovery Compass implementation provides players with a way to locate their last death position, helping them recover lost items. The Echo Shards serve as a rare material found in Ancient Cities, giving players an incentive to explore these dangerous structures in the Deep Dark biome. Together, these features add valuable functionality that improves the player experience when dealing with death in the game.

This completes the Wild Update transport and gear features. The Wild Update now has both Boat with Chest and Recovery Compass implemented with full functionality and comprehensive test coverage.

Next steps:
1. Implement the Echo Shards as chest loot in Ancient Cities
