Continue working on the game utilizing this and the sub links at this URL to continue development and add all the features and services that are in the repository. Use this file to keep track of each feature and service addition. Essentially you can use this as a one-to-one guide for project management, as you complete them update this file.

https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_version_history

To ensure that the features and services are added are correct you must create a test case to test the feature. Then you will test it, and if it passes you will update this file to reflect the completion of the feature or service.
You MUST NOT create work arounds, or hacks to make the feature or service work. You must add the feature or service in the correct way, by definition the correct way is fully developing the feature to be robust and useful.
