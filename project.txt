## Dependencies
- Node.js v18+
- Minecraft Server 1.24
- Required mods and plugins

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all new features
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Performance testing for new mechanics
- Security testing for portal system

## Documentation
- API documentation
- User guides

- Test documentation

## Deployment
- Staging environment setup
- Production deployment plan
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup
- Backup Procedures:
  * Automated backups run every hour
  * Manual backups available on demand
  * Maximum of 10 backups retained
  * Backup includes world data, player data, and configuration
  * Backup restoration process documented
  * Concurrent backups prevented
  * Backup manifest tracks metadata
  * Cleanup of old backups automated
  * Error handling with exponential backoff
  * Maximum error threshold (3) before system disable
  * Automatic error recovery with retry mechanism
  * Failed backup cleanup and manifest tracking
  * Scheduler control (start/stop/update interval)
  * Full documentation available in docs/backup-system.md

## Maintenance
- Regular updates
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization
- Security patches [x] Complete
- Backup System [x] Complete
  - Automated backups

## Additional Notes
- Project Status: All core features implemented and tested
- Security Implementation:
  * Vault Portal: Access control, cooldowns, secure teleportation
  * Wind Charge: Damage limits, radius limits, chain reaction controls
  * World System: Entity limits, permission checks, rate limiting
- Testing Coverage:
  * Unit tests for all components
  * Integration tests for feature interactions
  * Security tests for access control
  * Performance tests for entity limits
- Dependencies:
  * Node.js v18+ required
  * All core modules using real implementations
  * No mock implementations in production code
- Performance Considerations:
  * Entity limits per chunk: 100
  * Entity limits per player: 50
  * Wind charge chain reactions: max 3
  * Block operations rate limited
- Security Considerations:
  * All access points require permission checks
  * Damage and radius limits enforced
  * Cooldowns implemented for critical operations
  * Rate limiting for block operations
- Maintenance Notes:
  * Regular security audits recommended
  * Performance monitoring required
  * Entity limit adjustments may be needed based on server capacity
  * Backup procedures documented in deployment section
