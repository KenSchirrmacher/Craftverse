## Current Tasks
1. Implement additional Caves & Cliffs block types
2. Design and implement improved cave generation system
3. Design and implement mountain terrain improvements

## Completed Tasks
1. Implemented PowderSnow block with entity sinking mechanics and freezing damage
2. Implemented Goat mob with ramming behavior and powder snow interaction
3. Implemented Axolotl mob with hunting and play-dead mechanics
4. Created MountainGoat biome with increased goat spawns and powder snow patches
5. Implemented copper block with oxidation states
6. Implemented amethyst blocks with crystal growth mechanics
7. Implemented deepslate blocks for deep underground areas
8. Added dripstone cave generation with pointed dripstone blocks
9. Added lush caves with clay pools, dripleaf plants, and moss blocks
10. Implemented Squid and GlowSquid mobs with proper aquatic behavior

## Next Milestones
1. Finish remaining block implementations
2. Update world generation with new height limits
3. Implement new cave generation system
