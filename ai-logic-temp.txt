### 2024-08-05: Wild Update - Mangrove Swamp Biome and Mud Blocks Implementation ###

I have successfully implemented the Mangrove Swamp biome and related mud blocks for the Wild Update:

1. Implemented a comprehensive `MangroveSwampBiome` class that extends BiomeBase:
   - Created appropriate climate properties for a warm, wet environment (temperature: 0.8, precipitation: 0.9)
   - Implemented visual properties for a swamp-like appearance including:
     - Foggy atmosphere (fogDensity: 0.3)
     - Muddy water coloration (waterColor: '#617B64')
     - Olive-green vegetation (grassColor: '#6A7039', foliageColor: '#495225')
   - Designed terrain generation with:
     - Low-lying land (baseHeight: 0.1) 
     - Shallow pools using noise functions
     - Mud patches distributed across the terrain
   - Added feature generation for future mangrove trees, roots, and vegetation
   - Implemented entity slowness effects when walking on mud
   - Created proper mob spawning tables for frogs and tadpoles
   - Integrated with the BiomeRegistry for proper world generation

2. Implemented the Mud Block family:
   - Created base `MudBlock` class with:
     - Appropriate properties (hardness: 0.5, resistance: 0.5)
     - Slowing effect (slownessFactor: 0.6) on entities walking on it
     - Bubble particle effects for a wet appearance
     - Shovel as the preferred tool for faster mining
     - Water bottle interactions to maintain wetness
     - Proper serialization/deserialization for game state

   - Created `PackedMudBlock` as a dried variant:
     - Higher hardness and resistance than regular mud (hardness: 1.0, resistance: 3.0)
     - Water interactions to revert to regular mud
     - Neighbor block update handling for water proximity
     - Used as crafting material for mud bricks
     - Both pickaxe and shovel effectiveness for mining

   - Created `MudBricksBlock` as a building material:
     - Higher hardness and blast resistance (hardness: 1.5, resistance: 6.0)
     - Pickaxe requirement for efficient mining
     - Appropriate stone-like sound effects
     - Building block properties similar to other brick types

3. Updated the BlockRegistry to include all mud block variants, ensuring they're available for world generation and player use.

4. Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify:
   - MangroveSwampBiome properties and generation
   - Mud block interactions and effects
   - Performance of particle systems with mud bubbles
   - Tool interactions with all mud block variants
   - Water bottle interactions with different mud types

The Mangrove Swamp biome and mud blocks implementation provides players with a new environment to explore with unique terrain features and building materials. This completes another major component of the Wild Update, with future work needed on Mangrove trees and Frog/Tadpole mobs.

Next steps:
1. Implement Mangrove trees with their special root block system
2. Create Frog and Tadpole mobs with proper growth mechanics
3. Add special items like Mangrove Propagules and Boat with Chest
