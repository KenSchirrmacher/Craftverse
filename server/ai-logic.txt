### 2024-08-16: Trails & Tales Update - Hanging Signs Implementation Plan ###

Next, I'll implement the Hanging Signs feature from the Trails & Tales Update. Based on my analysis, there doesn't appear to be an existing sign implementation in the codebase. Therefore, I need to:

1. Create a comprehensive SignBlock base class that will serve as the foundation for both regular signs and hanging signs:
   - Support for different sign materials (oak, spruce, birch, etc.)
   - Text editing and formatting capabilities
   - Proper interaction handling
   - Directional placement (wall-mounted or standing)

2. Implement the HangingSignBlock class extending from SignBlock:
   - Support for ceiling and chain attachment
   - Different visual appearance and behavior from regular signs
   - Proper support chain visualization
   - All wood variants support
   - Different placement mechanics (requires block above)

3. Add HangingSignItem that places the HangingSignBlock
   - Material-specific variants
   - Proper placement validation
   - Integration with crafting system

4. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Test placement mechanics for hanging signs
   - Test text editing functionality
   - Test attachment points (ceiling, chain, wall)
   - Test proper serialization/deserialization
   - Test breaking mechanics and drops

I'll approach this by first creating a base SignBlock implementation, then extending it for HangingSignBlock to avoid duplicating code. I'll ensure proper integration with the existing block and item systems.
