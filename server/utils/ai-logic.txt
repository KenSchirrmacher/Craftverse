## Current Task: Wind Charge Improvements
The current task is to improve the Wind Charge feature from Minecraft 1.21 Update with new capabilities from the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales).

### Chain Reaction Implementation
For the chain reaction capability, we need to enhance the Wind Charge entity to detect and trigger nearby Wind Charges when it explodes. This creates a cascade effect similar to TNT in the base game.

Implementation steps:
1. Added a new triggerChainReaction() method to the WindChargeEntity class
2. Modified the explode() method to call triggerChainReaction() after applying explosion effects
3. Implemented radius-based detection for nearby wind charges
4. Added a delay mechanism for cascading explosions based on distance
5. Set direction vector for triggered charges to point away from the triggering explosion
6. Added comprehensive tests to verify chain reaction functionality works correctly
7. Verified both cases: charges within range trigger, and charges outside range do not trigger

The implementation was successfully tested and works correctly. This completes the chain reaction capability for Wind Charges.

## Next Steps
The next features to implement for Wind Charge Improvements are:
1. Block interactions - expand how Wind Charges interact with different block types
2. Visual and audio enhancements - improve effects for Wind Charge explosions
