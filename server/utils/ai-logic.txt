## Current Task: Wind Charge Improvements
The current task is to improve the Wind Charge feature from Minecraft 1.21 Update with new capabilities from the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales).

### Chain Reaction Implementation
For the chain reaction capability, we need to enhance the Wind Charge entity to detect and trigger nearby Wind Charges when it explodes. This creates a cascade effect similar to TNT in the base game.

Implementation steps:
1. Added a new triggerChainReaction() method to the WindChargeEntity class
2. Modified the explode() method to call triggerChainReaction() after applying explosion effects
3. Implemented radius-based detection for nearby wind charges
4. Added a delay mechanism for cascading explosions based on distance
5. Set direction vector for triggered charges to point away from the triggering explosion
6. Added comprehensive tests to verify chain reaction functionality works correctly
7. Verified both cases: charges within range trigger, and charges outside range do not trigger

The implementation was successfully tested and works correctly. This completes the chain reaction capability for Wind Charges.

### Enhanced Block Interactions Implementation
For the block interactions capability, we enhanced how Wind Charges interact with different block types when they explode.

Implementation steps:
1. Extended the tryMoveBlocks() method to handle special block interactions
2. Added a new getBlockInteraction() method to determine how to handle different block types
3. Implemented different behavior categories:
   - Light blocks (leaves, flowers): break with high force
   - Heavy blocks (stone, logs): require more force to move
   - Interactable blocks (buttons, levers): activate instead of moving
   - Transformable blocks (dirt): transform to different block types
   - Fragile blocks (glass): break easily
   - TNT: activate and spawn primed TNT entity
4. Added support for different interaction types: move, transform, activate, break
5. Created comprehensive tests to verify all interaction types
6. Verified the implementation works correctly for all test cases

The implementation and tests are complete. This enhances Wind Charges to behave more intelligently with different block types.

### Visual and Audio Enhancements Implementation
For the visual and audio enhancements, we improved the explosion effects of Wind Charges to make them more visually appealing and aurally immersive.

Implementation steps:
1. Implemented createExplosionVisuals() method to generate particle effects for explosions
   - Added explosion ring particles that radiate outward from the center
   - Added center explosion particles with random distribution
   - Added ground dust effect particles that kick up from below
   - Added lingering wind particles that persist longer for higher charge levels
   - Scaled particle count, size, and lifespan based on charge level
   - Used different particle colors based on charge level (from light to deep blue)

2. Implemented playExplosionSound() method to play appropriate sounds
   - Added primary explosion sound with volume and pitch scaled by charge level
   - Added secondary whoosh sound for medium and strong charges
   - Added ambient wind sound that lingers after the explosion
   - Implemented sound variations with different delay timings

3. Enhanced the block interaction visual effects
   - Added createBlockInteractionEffects() method to generate effects for different interaction types
   - Implemented specific visual effects for block movement, breaking, transforming, and activation
   - Added appropriate sound effects for each interaction type
   - Created helper methods to determine the appropriate sounds based on block type

4. Created comprehensive test suite (windChargeEnhancementsTest.js)
   - Created standalone test that validates visual and audio effects
   - Confirmed that effects scale properly with charge level
   - Verified that method calls work correctly in integration

The visual and audio enhancements have been successfully implemented and tested. The Wind Charge entity now produces appropriate visual and sound effects based on charge level, making the feature more engaging and providing better player feedback.

## Complete Feature Status
The Wind Charge Improvements feature is now complete with all components implemented:
1. Charging mechanics with power scaling ✓
2. Trajectory prediction system ✓
3. Chain reactions capability ✓
4. Enhanced block interactions ✓
5. Visual and audio enhancements ✓

## Next Steps
The next feature to implement is "Trail Ruins Structures" as part of the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales).
