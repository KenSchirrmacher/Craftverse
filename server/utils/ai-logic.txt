## Current Task: Wind Charge Improvements
The current task is to improve the Wind Charge feature from Minecraft 1.21 Update with new capabilities from the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales).

### Chain Reaction Implementation
For the chain reaction capability, we need to enhance the Wind Charge entity to detect and trigger nearby Wind Charges when it explodes. This creates a cascade effect similar to TNT in the base game.

Implementation steps:
1. Added a new triggerChainReaction() method to the WindChargeEntity class
2. Modified the explode() method to call triggerChainReaction() after applying explosion effects
3. Implemented radius-based detection for nearby wind charges
4. Added a delay mechanism for cascading explosions based on distance
5. Set direction vector for triggered charges to point away from the triggering explosion
6. Added comprehensive tests to verify chain reaction functionality works correctly
7. Verified both cases: charges within range trigger, and charges outside range do not trigger

The implementation was successfully tested and works correctly. This completes the chain reaction capability for Wind Charges.

### Enhanced Block Interactions Implementation
For the block interactions capability, we enhanced how Wind Charges interact with different block types when they explode.

Implementation steps:
1. Extended the tryMoveBlocks() method to handle special block interactions
2. Added a new getBlockInteraction() method to determine how to handle different block types
3. Implemented different behavior categories:
   - Light blocks (leaves, flowers): break with high force
   - Heavy blocks (stone, logs): require more force to move
   - Interactable blocks (buttons, levers): activate instead of moving
   - Transformable blocks (dirt): transform to different block types
   - Fragile blocks (glass): break easily
   - TNT: activate and spawn primed TNT entity
4. Added support for different interaction types: move, transform, activate, break
5. Created comprehensive tests to verify all interaction types
6. Verified the implementation works correctly for all test cases

The implementation and tests are complete. This enhances Wind Charges to behave more intelligently with different block types.

## Next Steps
The next feature to implement for Wind Charge Improvements is:
1. Visual and audio enhancements - improve effects for Wind Charge explosions
