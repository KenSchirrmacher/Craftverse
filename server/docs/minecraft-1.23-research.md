# Minecraft 1.23 Update Research Document

## Overview
This document contains research on the announced features for Minecraft 1.23 Update to plan the implementation in the Craftverse project.

## Announced Features
*Note: Since Minecraft 1.23 is still in development, these features are based on early announcements and may change.*

1. **Trailblazer** - A new villager profession focused on exploration
   - Sells maps to various structures and biomes
   - Offers special items for explorers
   - Has unique trades based on player discoveries

2. **Decorated Pots Expansion**
   - New pot decoration patterns
   - Enhanced functionality for decorated pots
   - Storage capabilities expansion

3. **Tamed Animal Improvements**
   - Extended commands for tamed animals
   - New training mechanics
   - Ability for animals to learn behaviors

4. **Copper Golem**
   - New constructable mob
   - Interacts with copper buttons and redstone
   - Oxidizes over time with different behaviors
   - Can be waxed to prevent oxidation

5. **Ancient Seeds**
   - New ancient plant types
   - Obtained from archaeological excavations
   - Grow into unique crops with special properties

## Technical Requirements

### Trailblazer
- New Villager profession class extension
- Map generation system integration
- Trade mechanics based on player exploration data
- Structure and biome integration

### Decorated Pots Expansion
- Extend the existing DecoratedPot implementation
- Add new pattern definitions
- Enhance inventory capabilities
- New crafting recipes

### Tamed Animal Improvements
- Extend Animal base class with training capability
- Command processing extensions
- Behavior learning system
- Integration with MobManager

### Copper Golem
- New entity implementation
- Oxidation state tracking and changes
- Redstone interaction mechanics
- Waxing functionality
- Construction/crafting recipe

### Ancient Seeds
- New item implementations
- Plant growth mechanics
- Archaeological site integration
- Unique crop properties and effects

## Implementation Priority
1. Copper Golem (highest priority - complex mob with oxidation and redstone interactions)
2. Trailblazer (high priority - involves villager system and exploration mechanics)
3. Tamed Animal Improvements (medium priority - enhances existing systems)
4. Decorated Pots Expansion (medium priority - extends existing feature)
5. Ancient Seeds (lower priority - can be added incrementally)

## Development Roadmap
1. Phase 1: Design and create test frameworks for all features
2. Phase 2: Implement Copper Golem and associated mechanics
3. Phase 3: Implement Trailblazer profession
4. Phase 4: Implement Tamed Animal Improvements
5. Phase 5: Implement Decorated Pots Expansion and Ancient Seeds
6. Phase 6: Integration testing and refinement

## Test Strategy
- Create unit tests for each new component
- Develop integration tests for interactions between new and existing systems
- Establish test environments for each feature
- Focus on edge cases for mob behavior and player interactions
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing features

## Questions to Resolve
1. How will Copper Golem interact with existing redstone systems?
2. What exploration data tracking is needed for Trailblazer trades?
3. How complex should the tamed animal training system be?
4. What new functionalities should decorated pots provide?
5. How will ancient seeds integrate with the existing agriculture system?
