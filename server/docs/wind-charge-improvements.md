# Wind Charge Improvements - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Wind Charge feature as part of the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales). The existing Wind Charge implementation from the 1.21 Update will be extended with new mechanics and improved functionality.

## Current Implementation
The existing Wind Charge feature consists of:
- `WindChargeItem`: Item that can be thrown
- `WindChargeEntity`: Entity created when the item is thrown that moves blocks and entities

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Charging Mechanic
- Add ability to "charge" the wind charge by holding right-click
- Implement 3 charge levels (weak, medium, strong)
- Each level increases power, range, and visual effects
- Create visual feedback during charging

#### Technical Implementation
- Add `chargeLevel` property to WindChargeItem
- Modify `useOnRelease` method to calculate charge level based on hold duration
- Update entity creation to pass charge level to the entity

### 2. Trajectory Prediction
- Implement a system to show where the Wind Charge will land
- Create translucent trail showing the predicted path
- Account for gravity, air resistance, and obstacles
- Scale prediction accuracy with charge level

#### Technical Implementation
- Create `WindTrajectoryPredictor` class
- Implement physics equations to calculate path
- Render client-side particles along predicted path
- Update prediction in real-time during charging

### 3. Chain Reactions
- Allow Wind Charges to trigger other placed Wind Charges
- Create cascading effects with strategic placement
- Implement area detection for triggering

#### Technical Implementation
- Add `isPlaced` state to WindChargeEntity
- Implement `detectNearbyWindCharges` method
- Create trigger event system for chain reactions
- Add `triggerRadius` property scaled by charge level

### 4. Block Interactions
- Expand interaction with specific blocks
- Create special effects with redstone components
- Implement unique interactions with certain materials
- Add "wind-charged" state to compatible blocks

#### Technical Implementation
- Create `WindInteractableBlock` interface
- Implement interface in compatible block classes
- Add `applyWindEffect` method for custom behaviors
- Create block state transitions for wind-charged state

### 5. Visual and Audio Enhancements
- Improve particle effects for different charge levels
- Add distinctive sounds for charging and release
- Create impact sounds based on surface material
- Implement screen shake effect for powerful charges

#### Technical Implementation
- Expand particle system to handle new effect types
- Create new sound resources for wind charge actions
- Implement impact sound selection based on block type
- Add screen shake effect proportional to charge power

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Charging Mechanics
- Update WindChargeItem with charge levels
- Modify entity creation to handle charge level
- Add basic visual feedback for charging

### Phase 2: Enhanced Physics & Trajectory
- Implement WindTrajectoryPredictor
- Create visual path prediction system
- Add charge-level based physics calculations

### Phase 3: Chain Reactions & Placement
- Add placement capability for Wind Charges
- Implement chain reaction detection and triggering
- Create cascade effect system

### Phase 4: Special Block Interactions
- Design and implement WindInteractableBlock interface
- Add special interactions for compatible blocks
- Create wind-charged block states

### Phase 5: Polish & Integration
- Enhance visual and audio effects
- Balance power levels and ranges
- Add integration with other game systems
- Comprehensive testing

## Test Plan
- Create unit tests for each enhancement
- Design integration tests for interaction with existing systems
- Implement physics simulation tests for trajectory prediction
- Create comprehensive tests for chain reactions
- Design tests for special block interactions

## Dependencies
- Existing WindChargeItem and WindChargeEntity classes
- Physics calculation library (may need to be created)
- Particle and sound effect systems
- Block state management system

## Risks and Mitigation
- Physics calculations may be performance-intensive: Implement optimization techniques and fallbacks
- Chain reactions could cause recursion issues: Add maximum chain depth and safety checks
- Complex interactions may introduce bugs: Comprehensive testing and incremental implementation
