## Documentation Tasks
1. Create comprehensive API documentation
2. Develop user guides for all major features
3. Create developer onboarding documentation
4. Document all block and entity properties

## Testing Improvements
1. Implement automated regression testing
2. Create performance benchmarks
3. Add stress tests for server capabilities
4. Improve test coverage for edge cases

## Timeline Estimates
- **Phase 1: Minecraft 1.21 Core Features** - 3 months
- **Phase 2: Technical Improvements** - 2 months
- **Phase 3: Gameplay Enhancements** - 2 months
- **Ongoing: Technical Debt Reduction** - Continuous

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a structured approach to future development of the Craftverse project.
