# Crafter Block Enhancements - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Crafter Block as part of the Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales). The existing Crafter Block from the 1.21 Update will be extended with new automation features, recipe management capabilities, and visual feedback systems.

## Current Implementation
The existing Crafter Block feature consists of:
- `CrafterBlock`: A block that can store a 3x3 grid of items for crafting
- `CrafterItem`: The corresponding item for placing the block
- Redstone activation for automated crafting
- Basic inventory management

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Recipe Memory System
- Add ability to "remember" the last successful recipe
- Implement recipe template storage in the block
- Create UI indicators for the remembered recipe
- Allow toggling between manual and template-based crafting

#### Technical Implementation
- Add `recipeMemory` property to CrafterBlock
- Create methods to save and clear recipe patterns
- Implement recipe comparison against memory
- Store recipe ingredients as templates (with wildcards for similar items)

### 2. Signal Strength Output
- Add comparator output based on crafting state
- Implement different signal strengths for different states:
  - 0: Empty/no recipe
  - 1-7: Partial recipe completion (based on percentage)
  - 8-14: Full recipe but not enough ingredients
  - 15: Ready to craft

#### Technical Implementation
- Implement `getComparatorOutput` method
- Create `calculateRecipeCompleteness` helper function
- Modify block update method to emit updates when state changes
- Add recipe validation against current inventory

### 3. Automated Recipe Management
- Create auto-refill capability from adjacent containers
- Implement input/output filtering system
- Add "lock slots" functionality to prevent unwanted item insertion
- Create redstone control modes (pulse, continuous, filtered)

#### Technical Implementation
- Add `craftingMode` property (manual, template, auto-refill)
- Implement adjacent container detection and interaction
- Create slot locking system with metadata
- Add redstone mode selection with cycling on interaction

### 4. Visual Feedback System
- Add particle effects for different crafting states
- Implement block appearance changes based on state
- Create sound effects for different operations
- Add client-side indicators for recipe memory status

#### Technical Implementation
- Create new particle effect types for crafting states
- Implement block model variants for different states
- Add sound emission on state changes
- Create overlay rendering for recipe memory display

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Recipe Memory System
- Extend CrafterBlock with recipe memory properties
- Implement recipe template matching algorithms
- Create UI for displaying saved recipes
- Add methods for saving/clearing recipes

### Phase 2: Signal Strength Output
- Implement comparator output calculation
- Create recipe completeness checking
- Add redstone emission logic
- Optimize updates to prevent unnecessary ticks

### Phase 3: Automated Recipe Management
- Add adjacent container detection
- Implement item transfer mechanics
- Create filtering system for inputs/outputs
- Add redstone control modes

### Phase 4: Visual Feedback System
- Design particle effects for different states
- Create sound effect implementation
- Implement block state variations
- Add client-side recipe memory indicators

### Phase 5: Testing & Integration
- Create comprehensive test cases for new features
- Integrate with existing crafting systems
- Balance automation capabilities
- Fix edge cases and bugs

## Dependencies
- Existing CrafterBlock and CrafterItem classes
- Crafting system and recipe manager
- Inventory and container management systems
- Redstone signal detection and emission system
- Particle and sound systems

## Test Plan
- Create unit tests for each enhancement
- Implement integration tests with existing systems
- Design edge case tests for recipe memory
- Create redstone automation test cases
- Implement visual feedback verification
