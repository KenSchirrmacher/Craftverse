# Minecraft 1.24 Update (Trail Tales) - Research Document

## Overview
The Minecraft 1.24 Update, known as "Trail Tales," introduces several new features focused on exploration, structure generation, and crafting enhancements. This document outlines the key features and implementation priorities for our Craftverse project.

## Key Features

### 1. Wind Charge Improvements
- Enhanced behavior for Wind Charges from 1.21 update
- Add charging mechanic for stronger wind effects
- Create trajectory prediction system
- Implement chain reactions with multiple charges
- Add special interaction with specific blocks

### 2. Trail Ruins Structures
- Implement new procedural structure generation
- Create unique loot tables for Trail Ruins
- Design multiple Trail Ruins variants
- Add special treasure chests with unique items
- Implement decay mechanics for structure blocks

### 3. Pottery Patterns
- Expand the existing pottery system
- Implement new pattern designs
- Create pattern combination mechanics
- Add special effects for pattern combinations
- Integrate with archaeology system

### 4. Crafter Block Enhancements
- Add automation improvements to existing Crafter block
- Implement recipe memory system
- Create inventory sorting capabilities
- Add redstone signal output based on crafting state
- Implement item filtering system

### 5. Vault Portal
- Design new dimension access mechanic
- Create portal block with unique activation requirements
- Implement Vault dimension with special generation rules
- Design unique mobs for the Vault dimension
- Create special rewards and challenges within the Vault

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Wind Charge Improvements** - Builds on existing system, relatively low complexity
2. **Pottery Patterns** - Extends existing decorated pots, moderate complexity
3. **Crafter Block Enhancements** - Improves existing block, moderate complexity
4. **Trail Ruins Structures** - New structure generation, higher complexity
5. **Vault Portal** - New dimension system, highest complexity

## Technical Considerations

### Wind Charge Improvements
- Extend the existing WindChargeEntity and WindChargeItem classes
- Add trajectory prediction algorithm using physics calculations
- Implement charge levels with corresponding power effects
- Create new particle effects for different charge levels

### Pottery Patterns
- Expand PotterySherdItem with new pattern types
- Update DecoratedPotItem to handle new pattern combinations
- Create effect registry for pattern combinations
- Add visual rendering for new patterns

### Crafter Block Enhancements
- Add memory slot to CrafterBlock storage
- Implement comparison system for recipe validation
- Create signal strength output based on crafting state
- Design UI improvements for recipe management

### Trail Ruins Structures
- Create TrailRuinsGenerator class for structure generation
- Implement multiple structure templates
- Design loot table system for ruins chests
- Add block aging/weathering system

### Vault Portal
- Design VaultPortalBlock with activation mechanics
- Create VaultDimension class extending BaseDimension
- Implement special generation rules for the Vault
- Design unique mob spawning system for Vault dimension

## Research Notes
- The real Minecraft doesn't have a "Vault" dimension - this is a custom feature inspired by modded Minecraft
- Trail Ruins are partially implemented in real Minecraft snapshots but with limited functionality
- Wind Charge improvements extend our existing implementation rather than matching real Minecraft features

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed technical design documents for each feature
2. Implement test frameworks for new systems
3. Begin implementation of Wind Charge improvements as the first priority
4. Schedule regular review checkpoints for each feature
