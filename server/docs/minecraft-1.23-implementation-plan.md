## Technical Approach

### Copper Golem
- Extend AbstractGolem class to create CopperGolem
- Implement IOxidizable interface (similar to copper blocks)
- Use state pattern for different oxidation states
- Implement AI behavior system for button interactions
- Add construction recipe to crafting system

### Trailblazer
- Extend VillagerProfession to create TrailblazerProfession
- Create MapGenerator class for structure and biome maps
- Implement PlayerExplorationTracker to manage discoveries
- Create reward system for player exploration achievements

### Tamed Animal Improvements
- Create AnimalTraining interface for trainable animals
- Implement TrainingManager to handle learning and behaviors
- Extend command system for more animal controls
- Create visual feedback system for training progress

### Decorated Pots Expansion
- Extend DecoratedPot class with enhanced functionality
- Create new PotPatternRegistry for decoration patterns
- Implement expanded inventory system for pots
- Add crafting recipes for new pot variations

### Ancient Seeds
- Create AncientSeed class hierarchy for different seed types
- Implement growth stages and mechanics
- Integrate with archaeological dig sites
- Create crop effect system for unique properties

## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies
- Copper Golem depends on existing redstone system
- Trailblazer depends on villager and map systems
- Tamed Animal Improvements depend on mob AI system
- Decorated Pots Expansion depends on existing pot implementation
- Ancient Seeds depend on agriculture and archaeology systems

### Risks
- Feature changes in official Minecraft 1.23 may require adjustment
- Integration with existing systems may reveal compatibility issues
- Performance impacts of new AI behaviors need monitoring
- Complex interactions between features may create unforeseen bugs

## Success Criteria
- All implemented features match official Minecraft 1.23 functionality
- All tests pass with 100% coverage
- No performance degradation from new features
- Seamless integration with existing Craftverse systems
- Complete documentation for all new features
