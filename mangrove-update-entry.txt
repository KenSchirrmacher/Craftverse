### 2024-08-05: Wild Update - Mangrove Swamp Biome and Mud Blocks Implementation ###

I have successfully implemented the Mangrove Swamp biome and related mud blocks for the Wild Update:

1. Created a comprehensive `MangroveSwampBiome` class that extends BiomeBase:
   - Implemented appropriate climate properties for a warm, wet environment
   - Added visual properties for a swamp-like appearance (fog, water color, etc.)
   - Created terrain generation with shallow pools and uneven ground
   - Implemented feature generation for mangrove trees, roots, and vegetation
   - Added entity effects for movement on mud (slowness)
   - Created proper mob spawning tables with future frogs and tadpoles
   - Integrated with the BiomeRegistry for world generation

2. Implemented the Mud Block family:
   - Created base `MudBlock` class with:
     - Appropriate properties (hardness, resistance, sounds)
     - Slowing effect on entities that walk on it
     - Particle effects for a wet, bubbling appearance
     - Tool interactions (faster mining with shovels)
     - Interactions with water bottles and other tools
     - Proper serialization/deserialization

   - Created `PackedMudBlock` as a dried variant:
     - Harder and more resistant than regular mud
     - Can be created by drying regular mud
     - Interaction with water to revert to regular mud
     - Special block update handling for neighboring water
     - Used as crafting material for mud bricks

   - Created `MudBricksBlock` as a building material:
     - Crafted from packed mud
     - Higher hardness and blast resistance
     - Requires pickaxe for efficient mining
     - Decorative building block properties
     - Proper tool efficiency and mining mechanics

3. Updated the BlockRegistry to register all mud block variants

4. Created a comprehensive test suite for verification:
   - Tests for MangroveSwampBiome properties and generation
   - Tests for biome registration and climate matching
   - Tests for all three mud block types
   - Tests for entity interactions with mud
   - Tests for tool interactions and mining
   - Tests for special block behaviors and updates

The Mangrove Swamp biome and its mud blocks are key components of the Wild Update, providing a unique ecosystem with distinctive terrain, blocks, and mechanics. The implementation follows the standard Minecraft features while providing proper integration with the existing game systems.

Next steps will include:
1. Implementing Mangrove trees and their special root blocks
2. Creating Frog and Tadpole mobs with proper growth mechanics
3. Adding special items like Mangrove Propagules and Boat with Chest
